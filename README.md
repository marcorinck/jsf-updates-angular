Update angularJS after JSF Ajax requests are complete

This small library updates angularJS state after a JSF AJAX request is complete. You can use angularJS directives
in a JSF page now without worrying that JSF AJAX requests updates elements with new angularJS directives that are 
not picked up by angularjS because DOM changes were happening outside of angularJS digest phase.
